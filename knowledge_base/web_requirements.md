Why does Stripe need my business website?
If you use a website, social media profile or mobile app to promote your business or sell products, Stripe needs to review it to understand your business and verify what you are selling in order to comply with financial regulations. See “Know Your Customer” obligations.

You are required to maintain a functioning website with the appropriate information at all times. Stripe regularly checks that the provided website is compliant and if it detects an issue, you will need to update it or provide a new website that satisfies the requirements.

What information is required?
Required immediately, your business website, social media profile, or mobile application, must include:

Your business name
Descriptions of the goods or services offered
These must align with the information you've provided to Stripe.

Stripe and our financial partners require the following additional information on your website, social media profile, or mobile application by the time you start selling your goods or services. Add it as soon as possible to avoid business disruptions. These requirements can come into effect more quickly if you operate in an industry with elevated financial risk.

Customer service contact details (this can be phone, email, address, contact form, or an online messaging service contact)
Return policy and process (if physical goods are sold)
Refund and dispute policy
Cancelation policy (if applicable)
Legal or export restrictions (if applicable)
Terms and conditions of any promotions
